# Fast-Parametric-Fourier-Transform
This Python code implements the Fast Parametric Fourier Transform(using time-decimation algorithm) and computes the gain and computational complexity to compare with Parametric Discrete Fourier Transform(FFT-P) . It also compares the execution time complexity with DFT-P , FFT and FFT-P.
